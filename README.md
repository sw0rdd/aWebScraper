# B1 Scraper


## Description
This is a web scraper that scrapes and analyzes information on some web sites built especially for this assignment.
<br>
starting point is https://courselab.lnu.se/scraper-site-1

## Scenario
The three friends Peter, Paul, and Mary usually get together one weekend every month to see a movie and, after that, eat at a restaurant. The problem is that it is hard to plan this event since they must find a time slot when all three are available, look for a movie that plays at the cinema that day, and finally see if they can book a table at their favorite restaurant. Since all this information is available through HTTP requests it would be nice to have a script that automates this workflow!
